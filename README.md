# Guitar Tech Signature

**Guitar Tech Signature** is an exploratory web application that profiles guitarists based on the **distribution of playing techniques** that define their musical identity.

Rather than ranking guitarists by speed, virtuosity, or genre expectations, this project focuses on *what techniques are used, how often they appear, and what role they play* in shaping a guitarist’s sound.

The result is not a score, but a **signature**.

## 🎸 Project Philosophy

Great guitarists are not defined by how many notes they play, but by **which techniques they rely on** and **how intentionally they use them**.

Many forms of mastery become invisible over time:

- Foundational techniques fade into muscle memory  
- Expressive gestures are used sparingly but meaningfully  
- Advanced techniques often appear less frequently, yet carry disproportionate impact  

This project aims to surface those patterns through data and visualization.

## 🔍 What This Project Is (and Is Not)

### This project **is**:
- A technique-centric lens for understanding guitarists  
- A data-driven visualization of musical identity  
- An educational tool for musicians, students, and educators  
- A foundation for comparing technique *distributions*, not skill hierarchies  

### This project is **not**:
- A leaderboard or rating system  
- A “shred” or speed comparison tool  
- A genre-biased evaluation  
- A judgment of musical worth

## 🧠 Core Idea

Each guitarist can be described by a **technique profile** composed of:

- **Foundational techniques** (core motor and rhythmic skills)
- **Expressive techniques** (phrasing, articulation, dynamics)
- **Advanced techniques** (high coordination, abstraction, or specialization)

These techniques are weighted and visualized to reveal:
- What dominates a guitarist’s playing
- Where restraint or emphasis appears
- How identity emerges through repetition and texture

## 📊 Data-Driven by Design

The application draws from **structured CSV data** designed for transparency and explainability.

### Data Sources Include:
- Interviews
- Guitar tech breakdowns
- Live performance analyses
- Educational and analytical content

Each source contributes a **confidence-weighted signal**, helping avoid mythology-driven or tab-only assumptions.
